## üìü Hello, world!

I'm a passionate developer with strong experience in Python and VBA ‚Äì especially when it comes to automating workflows, building calculation tools for engineers and developing smart, maintainable software. I love writing clean, efficient code and constantly explore new technologies to grow my skillset. Currently, I'm actively working on several private repositories.

**Mainly work with:**

  <summary><b>Projects</b></summary>
  Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on:

  - **Project Management App**

    Built with Python, PySide6 and SQLite ‚Äì a desktop tool for organizing project details, deadlines, and notes.

  - **Terminal Productivity Tool**

    Written in Python using Textual and SQLite. Designed to manage tasks in a Kanban-styled view and topic-based notes directly from the command line.

  - **Custom GUI Components Library**

    A Python package that provides reusable widgets for PySide6 and Tkinter, focused on rapid prototyping and consistent design.

  - **Personal Finance Tracker**

    Desktop budgeting app built with Java and SQLite ‚Äì aimed at tracking income, expenses and savings goals.

  - **Apple Music Controller**

    A native macOS app using Swift and SwiftUI that lets users control playback and manage Apple Music.

  - **File Backup Utility**

    Developed in Rust, this tool collects files from various source folders and organizes them into a backup structure.

  <summary>üõ†Ô∏è <b>Which technologies I use for what</b></summary>

  - **Python**

    Data analysis, automation, rapid prototyping and tool development

  - **VBA**

    Quick Excel-based solutions and workflow automation

  - **Rust**

    High-performance computations and safety-critical applications

  - **Java**

    Cross-platform desktop applications and future side projects

  - **Swift**

    Native macOS desktop applications

I enjoy working on GUIs, TUIs, and CLIs alike. For Python I use **PySide6**, **Tkinter** and **Textual** to build desktop GUIs. In Rust I use **Slint** and **Tauri** (frontend with web technologies).

I'm constantly learning. Currently:

  - Expanding my **Java** knowledge to support enterprise environments and revisit planned side projects
  - Exploring **C** and **C++** to deepen my understanding of memory management, low-level operations and performance-critical systems ‚Äì especially to better grasp the foundational concepts behind Rust.
